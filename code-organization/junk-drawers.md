# Junk Drawers

How often have you accumulated a "junk drawer" in your code base? I'm talking about the folder called "models", "services", or some equally non-meaning folder that you just pour code into. Class after class is added and over time you can have one folder with hundreds of items in it.

It can be nice that everything is in one flat namespace. But you give me no direction when I'm starting on your project to know what are the key classes? What is at the root of the solution. The Junk Drawer is one my personal anti-patterns.
