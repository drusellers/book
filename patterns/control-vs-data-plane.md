# Control vs Data Plane

A fun term vocab I've seen lately.

Relevant in Proxies

## Control Plane

An app or system that changes configuration data but doesn't touch the data.

Visualizes and controls the workers \(aka data plane\)

Listening on say 2000 and allows manipulations of the main application

## Data Plane

The app doing the work. Like a router. listening on 80/443 doing its biz
