# Foundations

In order to fuel a strong capability of rapid application development and deployment, I've been thinking about what I would build to unlock my developers.

## Goals

* don't force the development language
* don't force the app communication style
  * async via RabbitMQ / Kafka
  * sync via gRPC / Thrift

## Requirements

* leverage a protocol like Protocol Buffers or Avro
  * The goal here is to define a language independentnt schema of the messages
    * [https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)
    * [https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/)
* leverage type systems to reduce bugs and increase self documentationness

## Thoughts on language choices

My current list of languages I like are:

* F\#: Functional, massive .Net support, cross platform, scriptable and compiled, statically typed, runtime meta data
* C\#: Same as F\# with less functionalness
* Rust: awesome type system, native, fast - but strings are a bit PITA

### Languages I wouldn't use

Not that they are bad, just not ones I'm investing in for my own use

* Python: Love this language, but no types
* Ruby: This language is insanity to me
* Java: Would rather use .Net
* Clojure: Lack of typing, otherwise awesome
* Node/JavaScript: Callback hell, no typing

### On the fence about

* TypeScript
* JavaScript with Flow - i think I'm waiting for async/await to come to fruition
* Reason - see how long it lasts

## Thoughts on Operating System choice

The more I think about this, the more I feel like it has to be a linux environment so that I can automate the infrastructure. Window's just isn't there yet.

* CoreOS: [https://coreos.com/why/](https://coreos.com/why/) - auto updating minimal OS - for docker usage
* RancherOS: [http://rancher.com/rancher-os/](http://rancher.com/rancher-os/) - minimal OS for docker usage
* Debian: the more minimal than ubuntu but still has APT-GET
* Ubuntu: easier dev setup based on Debian and has APT-GET
* I want to look at NixOS: [https://nixos.org/](https://nixos.org/) - could have an even better package manager

## Thoughts on Cloud Providers

* AWS: The default
* DigitalOcean: Would like to look at and compare to AWS for simpler requirements

## CI tools

* Gitlab CI
* AppVeyor
* CodeShip 

### Make sure you have a private registry

* DockerHub for docker images
* Then set up the language specific registry for your choosen language
* You may need multiple to support your teams workflow \(a npm one for the UIUX team and a NuGet one for the .Net team\)

## CD Tools

## Infrastructure tooling

* Terraform
* Consul
* Packer

## Workload Scheduling

* Mesos / Mesosphere / DC/OS
* Kubernetes

## "Micro" Services

I like this series on moving to services
