# Who Do Companies Grow?

Understanding the context or the company you work for helps us build better software. Much has been written about how developers benefit from understanding the business model they operate in but how often have we looked at why companies even grow? What makes a company go from a single employee to a thousand employees? Why do companies form departments? In Economics this is a field of study called Industrial Organization which attempts to answer many of these questions. Allow me to give you a quick tour of this field of study because I believe it will be beneficial for us to understand. The majority of this section is my own interpretation of an article from Ronald Coase titled "The Nature of the Firm" from 1937.

## Why do companies grow?

Going from the solo entrepreneur, to making your first hire will happen for many reasons. At its core I believe that firms will tend to hire people for one real reason. Abstracting out complexity from the entrepreneur.

In the beginning, a firm is an idea. A single entrepreneur can work on it, but at some point she will need help. I currently think that companies hire for two specific reasons.

1. To hide subject complexity
2. To hide interaction complexity

### To Hide Subject Complexity

We hire accountants early on in the life of a company in the US because the tax code is so complex that no one outside of the tax community is expected to fully understand it. Anytime a company runs into one of these "sharp" points, it invariable either hires someone to soften the point for them or they simply ignore it like an ingrown toenail. It hurts, but only when I bump it.

### To Hide Interaction Complexity

We hire a customer service team to shield us from the sheer volume of interactions with our customer base. Each interaction with a customer could be entirely unique and need a new mind set to address interacting with another human mind. Even when the interaction is not unique and is a part of the standard operating procedures (cancelling my account, etc) the sheer volume of these can overwhelm an entrepreneur.

> a sub point of interaction complexity?

> The interaction complexity of shifting focus. The CEO doing A, B, C leads to inefficiencies.

## The Mechanical Turk

As the company grows, it increases it's head count. Increasing your head count is one of the most expensive ways to grow. Software, has the magic ability to replace head count with itself. In doing so, software can mow through work faster than any human. Additionally, software does a fantastic job at working through the easy items. This means that only hard problems are left. Which means you only need a single or few dedicated, senior staff to run what would have once taken an army.

Software on the other hand doesn't, yet, do well with highly complex, judgement based decisions.

> Software systems can replace well defined work that a human is currently doing. Once a system becomes so predictable that "a monkey could do it" that typically becomes the moment that automated systems start to appear attractive.

### Why do companies hire people?

Robert Coase argues that companies grow because using the market pricing system for transactions is inherently inefficient. It is this _transactional_ nature that I find the most interesting in regards to staffing, head count and software.

The transactional cost of software is effectively zero. We have systems that can process millions of transactions a second for the simple operating cost of a few servers (Roughly $50/mth in 2016). 

The cost of acquiring a software system is more akin to hiring someone than it is engaging a "contractor". The upfront cost is high as you must interview the provider of the service, but once you've agreed that the fit is good, the overall cost of the transactions virtually disappears.
