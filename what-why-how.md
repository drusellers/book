# What Why How

In a What / Why / How we are writing to separate out these three concepts and establish a true understanding of the goal.

As a prime example, I'll often come to the conversation with a strong HOW that I want to implement. Instead I should think about the "what" and "why" of this "how" that I'm fired up about. Doing so will let me understand the real goal, and then I can easily discuss the goal with others. We can discuss if the why is correct. We can discuss if the what is necessary with out getting caught up in the "how."

The how becomes an implementation detail. The higher up in an organization you get, you will need to let go of the "how" and focus instead on the whats and whys.
