# Company RFCs

An RFC is a "Request For Comment" is the official documentation of business specifications, process, data and events for a company. This is currently an experimental thought for me, as it would take a decent amount of high level buy in and self control to implement. Additionally businesses aren't OSS projects trying to gather larger consensus. This section of the document is heavily influenced by Python and Rust as well as other RFC based communities.

## What is an RFC?

RFC stands for Request for Comment. This document defines a process for collecting, reviewing, sorting, and recording the results of proposals for enhancements to the business systems, methodologies, and for related efforts, such as process and infrastructure improvements. This document outlines various categories of RFCs and we invite the ratification and change of RFCs to enhance our process.

## Motivations and Goal

The primary goal of this area of Confluence and the MEPs is to not create a burden but rather a way to share common or lasting information such that we create a road map of the decisions, processes, and systems. Much of what we do today is likely deserving of a MEP, we just don't see or think of it that way \(see informational note below\).

A secondary goal is to have a unified format for sharing information and a central archive of proposals so that they are easy to for all of those interested to find, read, comment upon, and contribute to \(e.g. enhance\).

This process is open to anyone with access to this space. Decisions and discussions will be made in a transparent manner, but are ultimately up to the leadership team.

> For many of us weâ€™ve operated in small teams with focus on single businesses. We would invite you to set aside the past and think instead of what is needed, if our focus is to serve all of the MAG companies. What worked for a team of three may not longer work with a team of 40+. We invite you bring forward what has worked and explore how to apply it to this environment so that we may all benefit together.

Currently, when having discussions about improvements to process or MAG development operations, it is not always clear when consensus has been reached or a decision is made, and people willing to implement it may start too early, leading to wasted efforts, or delay it indefinitely, because there's not clear indication it is time to begin. At the same time, potential adopters of an enhancement may not be able to easily assess whether they should use said implementation or not, because it's difficult to know whether it adjusts to the consensus reached during the discussion period.

Our normative documents rely on wide adoption of a practice before documenting it, and adopters can be reluctant to make use of it before a clear indication that a practice has some consensus behind it. This creates a hard to break loop that this process hopes to alleviate, by providing a mechanism to reflect the status of each proposal, including whether it has reached consensus or not.

By using this process, people involved in developing any enhancement can help to build such index, with very little overhead required on their part.

## Overview

MEPs are ultimately about getting better. By inviting ourselves to be disciplined in our process, we aim to improve. The goal is not rigid structure and formality, but rather limits within which there is freedom to operate.

## MEP Types

We're early in this process but not all MEPs are equal, and treating them that way can cause confusion. Currently we're thinking about two types of MEPs, Informational and Projects. Projects are further breakdown into Development Project MEPs \(e.g. "Upgrade build server infrastructure"\) to Business Project MEPs \(e.g. "Make new feature on website"\). Informational MEPs convey and document information about systems, processes, and decisions.

### Proposed MEP Categories:

* Process
* Development Practices
* Projects

We want the types of MEPs to make sense. If you start to experience a pain point \(as we did very early on with the distinction between development project MEP and business project MEP\) please surface your pain to discuss a potential remedy.

### Workflow

The workflow for MEPs today is non-existent. This is a new area where we seek to defer until a problem or need for more defined workflow emerges. If there is a defined workflow, it is that decisions and MEPs are being made by the development leadership team.

#### MEP Statuses

* Draft - has not yet been submitted or approved
* Ratified - different meaning that accepted?
* Accepted - MEP has been approved by leadership team
* Living - indicates a MEP has been approved by leadership team though may change frequently \(is this needed?\)
* Closed?
* Rejected?
