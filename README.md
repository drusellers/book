# Introduction

This book is an attempt to document all of my thoughts, ideas, and peculiarities around developing applications as well as my personal philosophies on the "Nature of the Firm". As a veteran .Net developer the majority of this will be colored by the .Net languages and environment.

I also believe that the organizational construct that we operate in will impact the way we develop our software. That Conway's law is truely in effect.

> organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations \*

> Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where significant is measured by cost of change.

> Grady Booch

> Architecture is the decisions that you wish you could get right early in a project, but that you are not necessarily more likely to get them right than any other.
